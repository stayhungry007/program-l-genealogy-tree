### Principia Mathematica

> The Principia Mathematica (often abbreviated PM) is a three-volume work on the foundations of mathematics, written by **Alfred North Whitehead** and **Bertrand Russell** and published in **1910**, **1912**, and **1913**.

### The Principles of Mathematics

> The Principles of Mathematics is a book written by Bertrand Russell in 1903. In it he presented his famous paradox and argued his thesis that mathematics and logic are identical.[1]
>
> The book presents a view of the foundations of mathematics and has become a classic reference. It reported on developments by Giuseppe Peano, Mario Pieri, Richard Dedekind, Georg Cantor, and others.

## David Hilbert

> In mathematics and computer science, the **Entscheidungsproblem** (pronounced [ɛntˈʃaɪ̯dʊŋspʁoˌbleːm], German for 'decision problem') is a challenge posed by David Hilbert in **1928**. The **Entscheidungsproblem** asks for an algorithm that takes as input a statement of a first-order logic (possibly with a finite number of axioms beyond the usual axioms of first-order logic) and answers "Yes" or "No" according to whether the statement is universally valid, i.e., valid in every structure satisfying the axioms.
>
> The origin of the Entscheidungsproblem goes back to Gottfried Leibniz, who in the seventeenth century, after having constructed a successful mechanical calculating machine, dreamt of building a machine that could manipulate symbols in order to determine the truth values of mathematical statements.

## John von Neumann

> Von Neumann joined the IAS (Princeton) in 1933. He was the youngest of the original six Professors of Mathematics in the IAS, a position he retained for the remainder of his life.
> In 1935 at Cambridge, **Turing** attended M.H.A. **Newman’s** course on the Foundations of Mathematics. There, Turing confronted three notions being set forth by **David Hilbert** about the inherent nature of mathematics. Was mathematics complete? Was mathematics consistent? And was mathematics decidable? Hilbert had assumed that the answer to all three questions would be ‘yes.’ At its heart, the question was: "Could any mathematical problem be solved?"

## Kurt Gödel

> By **1928**, **Gödel** had proved that the answer to the first two questions actually was ‘no,’ that arithmetic could not be proven to be both complete and consistent. But the third question remained open. As Hilbert had put it, was there a definite method, a mechanical process which could be applied to a mathematical statement… to determine if or not it was provable?

## Alonzo Church

> As was his wont, **Turing** had worked in isolation, unaware that at Princeton Professor Alonzo Church (1903-1995), just nine years Turing’s senior, had also taken on Hilbert.  In a first paper, Church and students Stephen Kleene and John Barkley Rosser created lambda-calculus. In a second paper, Church used the new system to support his proof that the Entscheidungsproblem is undecidable for Peano arithmetic. Church presented the first paper in April **1935** before the American Mathematical Society. The second appeared in the Journal of Symbolic Logic just as Turing was finishing the first draft of his paper.

## Alan Turing

> Newman, who appears to have taken some time to get to Turing’s draft, wrote to Church:
>
> “An offprint which you sent me recently of your paper in which you define ‘calculable numbers’ and show that the Entscheidungsoroblem for Hilbert logic is insoluble had a rather painful interest for a young man, AM Turing here who was just about to send in for publication a paper in which he used a definition of “computable Numbers” for the same purpose. His treatment, which consists in describing a machine which will grind out any computable sequence- is rather different from yours, but seems to be of great merit, and I think it of great importance that he should come and work with you next year if that is at all possible.”
