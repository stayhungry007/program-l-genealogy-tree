# Great Computer scientists

Not in any specific order

## Grace Brewster Murray Hopper

> Grace Brewster Murray Hopper (December 9, 1906 – January 1, 1992), née Grace Brewster Murray, was an American computer scientist and United States Navy Rear Admiral. She was one of the first programmers of the Harvard Mark I computer in 1944, invented the **first compiler** for a computer programming language, and was one of those who popularized **the idea of machine-independent programming languages** which led to the development of **COBOL**, one of the **first high-level programming languages**.
>
>In 1952 she had an operational compiler. "Nobody believed that," she said. "I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. They told me computers could only do arithmetic."
>
>In **1954** Hopper was named the company's first director of automatic programming, and her department released some of the first compiler-based programming languages, including **MATH-MATIC** and **FLOW-MATIC**.
>
> In the spring of **1959**, a two-day conference known as the Conference on Data Systems Languages (CODASYL) brought together computer experts from industry and government. Hopper served as a technical consultant to the committee, and many of her former employees served on the short-term committee that defined the new language **COBOL** (an acronym for **CO**mmon **B**usiness-**O**riented **L**anguage). The new language extended Hopper's **FLOW-MATIC** language with some ideas from the IBM equivalent, **COMTRAN**. Hopper's belief that programs should be written in a **language that was close to English** (rather than in machine code or in languages close to machine code, such as assembly languages) was captured in the new business language, and COBOL went on to be the most ubiquitous business language to date.

## Fortran

> In late 1953, John W. Backus submitted a proposal to his superiors at IBM to develop a more practical alternative to assembly language for programming their IBM 704 mainframe computer. Backus' historic FORTRAN team consisted of programmers Richard Goldberg, Sheldon F. Best, Harlan Herrick, Peter Sheridan, Roy Nutt, Robert Nelson, Irving Ziller, Lois Haibt, and David Sayre. Its concepts included easier entry of equations into a computer, an idea developed by J. Halcombe Laning and demonstrated in his GEORGE compiler of 1952.

## John Backus

> John Warner Backus (December 3, 1924 – March 17, 2007) was an American computer scientist. He directed the team that invented the first widely used high-level programming language (**FORTRAN**) and was the inventor of the Backus-Naur form (**BNF**), a widely used notation to define formal language syntax. He also did research in function-level programming and helped to popularize it.
>
> Programming was very difficult at this time, and in 1954 Backus assembled a team to define and develop Fortran for the IBM 704 computer. Fortran was the first high-level programming language to be put to broad use.
>
> Backus made another, critical contribution to early computer science: during the latter part of the 1950s Backus served on the international committees that developed **ALGOL 58** and the very influential **ALGOL 60**, which quickly became the de facto worldwide standard for publishing algorithms. Backus developed the Backus-Naur Form (BNF), in the UNESCO report on ALGOL 58. It was a formal notation able to describe any context-free programming language, and was important in the development of compilers. This contribution helped Backus win the Turing Award.

## LISP

> Lisp (historically, LISP) is a family of computer programming languages with a long history and a distinctive, fully parenthesized prefix notation. Originally specified in 1958.
> As one of the earliest programming languages, Lisp pioneered many ideas in computer science, including tree data structures, automatic storage management, dynamic typing, conditionals, higher-order functions, recursion, and the self-hosting compiler.
> The name LISP derives from "LISt Processor". Linked lists are one of Lisp's major data structures, and Lisp source code is made of lists. Thus, Lisp programs can manipulate source code as a data structure, giving rise to the **macro** systems that allow programmers to create new syntax or new **domain-specific languages** embedded in Lisp.

## John McCarthy

> John McCarthy (September 4, 1927 – October 24, 2011) was an American computer scientist and cognitive scientist. McCarthy was one of the founders of the discipline of artificial intelligence. He coined the term "artificial intelligence" (**AI**), developed the **Lisp** programming language family, significantly influenced the design of the **ALGOL** programming language, popularized **timesharing**, and was very influential in the early development of AI.

## ALGOL 58

> ALGOL 58, originally known as IAL, is one of the family of ALGOL computer programming languages. It was an early compromise design soon superseded by ALGOL 60. According to John Backus[2]
>
> ALGOL 58 introduced the fundamental notion of the compound statement, but it was restricted to control flow only, and it was not tied to identifier scope in the way that Algol 60's blocks were.

## ALGOL 60

> ALGOL 60 (short for **ALGO**rithmic **L**anguage 19**60**) is a member of the ALGOL family of computer programming languages. It followed on from ALGOL 58 which had introduced **code blocks** and the `begin` and `end` pairs for delimiting them. ALGOL 60 was the first language implementing **nested function definitions with lexical scope**. It gave rise to many other programming languages, including CPL, Simula, BCPL, B, Pascal and C.
>
> **Niklaus Wirth** based his own ALGOL W on ALGOL 60 before moving to develop Pascal. Algol-W was intended to be the next generation ALGOL but the ALGOL 68 committee decided on a design that was more complex and advanced rather than a cleaned simplified ALGOL 60. The official ALGOL versions are named after the year they were first published. Algol 68 is substantially different from Algol 60 and was criticised partially for being so, so that in general "Algol" refers to dialects of Algol 60.

## Edsger W. Dijkstra

> Dijkstra was known to be a fan of **ALGOL 60**, and worked on the team that implemented the first compiler for that language. He was closely involved in the ALGOL 60 development, realisation and popularisation. As discussed by Peter Naur in the article 'The European side of the last phase of the development of ALGOL 60', in the Proceedings of the First ACM SIGPLAN Conference on History of Programming Languages, January 1978, Dijkstra took part in the period 1958–1959 in a number of meetings that culminated in the publication of the report defining the ALGOL 60 language. Dijkstra's name does not appear in the list of 13 authors of the final report. Apparently, he eventually left the committee because he could not agree with the majority opinions. Still, while at the Mathematisch Centrum (Amsterdam), he wrote jointly with Jaap Zonneveld the first ALGOL 60 compiler. Dijkstra and Zonneveld, who collaborated on the compiler, agreed not to shave until the project was completed; while Zonneveld shaved shortly thereafter, Dijkstra kept his beard for the rest of his life.

>  Per Brinch Hansen, a pioneer in the field of concurrent computing, considers Dijkstra's Cooperating Sequential Processes (1965) to be the first classic paper in concurrent programming. As Brinch Hansen notes, 'Dijkstra lays the conceptual foundation for abstract concurrent programming' with that paper.

## Niklaus Emil Wirth

> Wirth was the chief designer of the programming languages **Euler**, **Algol W**, **Pascal**, **Modula**, **Modula-2**, **Oberon**, **Oberon-2*, and **Oberon-07**. He was also a major part of the design and implementation team for the Lilith and Oberon operating systems, and for the Lola digital hardware design and simulation system. He received the ACM Turing Award for the development of these languages in 1984 and in 1994 he was inducted as a Fellow of the ACM. He designed the simple programming language PL/0 to illustrate compiler design. It has formed the basis for many university compiler design classes.
