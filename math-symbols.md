# Math symbols

## Mathematical Logic

    ⇒  (the implies sign) means “logically implies that”
    ⇔  (the iff sign) means “if and only if” and is used to connect logically equivalent statements
    ∀  for all
    ∃  there exists
    ∄  there does not exist
    ¬  not sign
    ∴  therefore
    ∵  because
    ∎  end of proof

    ⊦  assertion
       "infers in". The symbol was first published in [Frege 1879]
    ⊧  models
    ⊨  true
    ⊩  forces
    ⊬  does not prove
    ⊭  not true
    ⊮  does not force

    ∧  logical and
    ∨  logical or
    ⊻  xor
    ⊼  nand
    ⊽  nor

## Sets

    ∈  element of
    ∉  not an element of
    ∋  contains as member
    ∌  does not contain as member
    ∩  intersection
    ∪  union
    ⊂  subset of
    ⊃  superset of
    ⊄  not a subset of
    ⊅  not a superset of
    ⊆  subset of or equal to
    ⊇  superset of or equal to
    ⊈  neither a subset of nor equal to
    ⊉  neither a superset of nor equal to
    ⊊  subset of with not equal to
    ⊋  superset of with not equal to
