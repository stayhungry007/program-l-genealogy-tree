## Beyond Turing Machines

I can think of at least two mainstreams ideas of "Beyond Turing Machines":

 - Actors model, Inconsistency Robustness, Pi-calculus and all ideas of Carl Hewitt. He has publications where he proves contradiction of Godel theorem (seems not widely accepted), and Actors meant to be superset of Turing Machines.
 - [Quantum computation](https://quantiki.org/wiki/basic-concepts-quantum-computation), [quantum logic](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qt-quantlog/). First idea to build computer on quantum gates was suggested by Richard Feynman.

I differentiate them, but they have common "roots" (Actors model partially inspired by Quantum Computing).

## Carl Hewitt

> Carl Eddie Hewitt (/ˈhjuːɪt/) is a computer scientist who designed the **Planner** programming language for automated planning and the **Actor model** of **concurrent computation**, which have been influential in the development of logic, **functional** and **object-oriented programming**. Planner was the first programming language based on procedural plans invoked using pattern-directed invocation from assertions and goals. The Actor model influenced the development of the **Scheme** programming language, the π-calculus, and served as an inspiration for several other programming languages.
