## On OOP

See my other NOTE on OOP http://stereobooster.github.io/two-big-schools-of-object-oriented-programming.

Need to update it, because my view slightly changed. I would distinguish two types of OOP (still callimng them OOP for history reason).

 - Message-Oriented Programing - what Alan Kay meant by OOP and implemented in **SmallTalk**. **Ruby** can be considered as biggest succesor
 - Simulation-Oriented Programming - what Ole-Johan Dahl, Kristen Nygaard in **Simula 67**. **C++** can be considered as biggest succesor

## Simula

> Simula is the name of two simulation programming languages, **Simula I** and **Simula 67**, developed in the 1960s at the Norwegian Computing Center in Oslo, by **Ole-Johan Dahl** and **Kristen Nygaard**. Syntactically, it is a fairly faithful superset of **ALGOL 60**.
>
> Simula 67 introduced objects, classes, 2 inheritance and subclasses, virtual procedures, coroutines, and discrete event simulation, and features garbage collection.

## Smalltalk

> Smalltalk is an object-oriented, dynamically typed, reflective programming language.
>
> Designed by **Alan Kay**, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg

> What I got from Simula was that you could now replace bindings and assignment with goals. The last thing you wanted any programmer to do is mess with internal state even if presented figuratively. Instead, the objects should be presented as sites of higher level behaviors more appropriate for use as dynamic components.”
